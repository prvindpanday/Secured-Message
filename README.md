# Secured-Message
a secured messaging system where your messages are kept secure and your chats are upto you only  
This project is to propose a new Multisignature scheme without a trusted third party (TTP), based on a round optimal, publicly verifiable
DKG protocol. The proposed scheme can be easily adapted to incorporate a TTP; a version of the proposed scheme with the assistance of a 
TTP will therefore not be presented. 
	
The proposed discrete logarithm-based Multisignature scheme is also proactively secure, allowing for DKR to a new access structure and 
periodic DKU to mitigate attacks from an active/mobile adversary. The proposed discrete logarithm-based Multisignature scheme is made 
proactively secure by periodically updating secret shares and facilitating changes in group membership by allowing an authorized subset 
of existing group members to redistribute secret shares to a new access structure.
	
The scheme fulfills all the fundamental properties of generic Multisignature schemes given in the properties of Multisignature and resists 
attacks to which other similar schemes are subject.
